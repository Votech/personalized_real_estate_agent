# Real Estate Listing Generator

A Python project that generate, store, search, and enhance real estate property listings based on your preferences, using LLMs (OpenAI), sentence embeddings, and ChromaDB.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository and open the project directory.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
cd personalized_real_estate_agent

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Run the program from your terminal:

```bash
python3 HomeMatch.py
```

## Listings generation
The program comes with a pre-generated set of listings. You can generate new listings by answering yes to the prompt that asks if you want to generate a new listing, addtionally, you can choose the number of listings you want to generate and the temperature of the generation.

## Semantic Search
The program will ask you a series of questions to understand your preferences for the property you are looking for. The program will use your answers to search for the most relevant listings in the database. The program will return a list of the most relevant listings based on your answers.

## Augmentation
The listing descriptions retrieved from the database are augmented to better highlight how the property meets your preferences. This feature tends to hallucinate a little bit, but I left it as it is, because it's better showcasing the augmentation itself for the purpose of this exercise.

### Example of the augmentation:
```python
user_preferences = {
    'size': 'A comfortable three-bedroom house with a spacious kitchen and a cozy living room.',
    'important_factors': 'A quiet neighborhood, good local schools, and convenient shopping options.',
    'amenities': 'A backyard for gardening, a two-car garage, and a modern, energy-efficient heating system.',
    'transport': 'Easy access to a reliable bus line, proximity to a major highway, and bike-friendly roads.',
    'urbanity': 'A balance between suburban tranquility and access to urban amenities like restaurants and theaters.'
}
```
